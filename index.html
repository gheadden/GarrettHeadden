				<h1>who i am</h1>
				<p>my name is Garrett Headden.  i was born and raised in Knoxville, TN.  the son of two hard-working, business-minded parents.</p>
				
				<p>i have just recently graduated from the University of Tennessee with a degree in business management and entrepreneurship.</p>

				<p>as a business professional, i am an entrepreneur.  more specifically a web developer and marketing specialist.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="why-i-am-here">
				<h1>why i am here</h1>
				<p>my passion is communication.  making it easier.  more transparent.</p>
				
				<p>if everyone communicated openly and honestly, life’s processes would streamline.</p>

				<p>communication drives relationships.  relationships encourage mindfulness.  mindfulness stimulates open minded thinking, and open minded thinking brings greater knowledge.</p>

				<p>knowledge has to be the foundation of where we go next because ignorance kills creativity.  ignorance kills collaboration.  ignorance kills the basis of every bit of progress we try to make over time.</p>

				<p>my vision is to create a world where people communicate at a level where ignorance and judgment are nonexistent, knocking down any self-made barrier placed in the way of progress and learning.</p>

				<p>the only things left to ask…</p>
				
				<p>are we willing to work harder?</p>
				
				<p>are we willing to care that much?</p>
				
				<p>are we willing to be entirely selfless, yet remain confident and motivated at the same time?</p>
				
				<p>can we be a sponge for knowledge, but never lose grasp on the knowledge we have to offer the world?</p>
